Nearby. is a project that was built with the goal of creating a platform on the web that 
could help people find events near them via an interactive map. 

It gives users the tools to create accounts, log-in with custom authentication, create 
public or private password-protected events, and join events to see the details. 
This is a passion project that I plan on continuing to develop and refine long-term.
This is my most recently started project and is a work-in-progress.
